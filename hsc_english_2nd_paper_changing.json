      "c": "How a beautiful place it is!",
      "d": "The place is very beautiful."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Exclamatory sentences (আবেগসূচক বাক্য) starting with 'What a/What an' are used for singular nouns. The correct structure is 'What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' Here, 'place' is a singular noun, so 'What a beautiful place it is!' is correct."

      "c": "Was he known to you?",
      "d": "Does he known to you?"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "In passive voice (কর্মবাচ্য), the object becomes the subject. The active sentence is in the present indefinite tense. The passive form is 'Is/Am/Are + subject + past participle + by/to?' For the verb 'know', we use 'to' instead of 'by' after the past participle."

      "c": "All can do this.",
      "d": "Everybody can do this."

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The negative (নেতিবাচক) word 'Nobody' (কেউ না) can be changed to the affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) word 'Everybody' (সবাই) to make the sentence affirmative without changing the meaning. 'Nobody can do this' means 'Everybody can do this' is incorrect. Actually, 'Nobody can do this' means 'All cannot do this' but the direct affirmative is 'Everybody can do this' is the opposite. The correct affirmative transformation for 'Nobody can do this' is 'All can do this'. Option D is the correct choice."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "For present indefinite tense (বর্তমান indefinite কাল) with a third-person singular subject ('He'), we use the auxiliary verb 'Does' to form a question. The main verb then returns to its base form (play)."

      "d": "He is often late."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The adverb 'sometimes' (কখনো কখনো) can be made negative by changing it to 'not always' (সবসময় না). The negative transformation of 'He is sometimes late' is 'He is not always late', which conveys a similar meaning."

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "When changing a question starting with 'Who' into passive voice (কর্মবাচ্য), we use 'By whom' at the beginning, followed by the auxiliary verb, then the subject, and then the past participle. The correct structure is 'By whom + was/were + subject + past participle?'"

      "c": "Let the sum do by me.",
      "d": "The sum be done by me."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "For imperative sentences (অনুজ্ঞাসূচক বাক্য) starting with 'Let', the passive structure is: 'Let + object + be + past participle.' 'Me' becomes 'I' in the active, but in passive, it becomes 'by me' at the end. So, 'Let the sum be done by me' is correct."

      "c": "He is more intelligent than his brother.",
      "d": "His brother is not intelligent."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "'Not less...than' (থেকে কম না) is a negative structure that implies equality. The affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) equivalent is the positive degree 'as...as'. 'He is as intelligent as his brother' correctly transforms the sentence without changing the meaning."

    "options": {
      "a": "He must not go there.",
      "b": "He cannot go there.",
      "c": "He may not go there.",
      "d": "He did not go there."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The modal verb 'must' (অবশ্যই) expresses strong obligation. Its negative form is 'must not' (উচিত হবে না/নিষেধ), which indicates prohibition. So, 'He must not go there' is the correct negative transformation."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "description": "A complex sentence (জটিল বাক্য) has one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. The simple adjective 'wounded' can be expanded into an adjective clause. 'I saw a bird which was wounded' is the correct complex form, where 'which was wounded' is the adjective clause."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The active sentence is in the present continuous tense (বর্তমান চলমান কাল): 'are helping'. The passive structure for present continuous is 'is/am/are + being + past participle'. Therefore, 'The flood victims are being helped by people' is correct."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A negative (নেতিবাচক) statement can often be turned into an affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) question. 'Nobody' (কেউ না) becomes 'anybody' (কেউ) in the interrogative form. So, 'Will anybody deny this?' is the correct transformation, expecting an answer like 'No, they will not.'"

      "d": "He must work hard for succeed."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The simple sentence uses an infinitive ('to succeed') to show purpose. A compound sentence (যৌগিক বাক্য) is formed by using a coordinating conjunction. The idea is that if he does not work hard, he will not succeed. So, the correct compound form is 'He must work hard or he will not succeed.'"

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "For exclamatory sentences (আবেগসূচক বাক্য) with adjectives, we use 'How' before the adjective. The structure is 'How + adjective + subject + verb!' Here, 'scenery' is the subject, so 'How charming the scenery of this place is!' is correct. 'What' is used before a noun phrase (e.g., What charming scenery)."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The positive degree (সকারাত্মক) sentence 'No other...as...as' implies superiority. Its comparative (তুলনামূলক) form is 'He is better than any other student'. 'Better' is the comparative form of 'good'."

    "correct_answer": "c",

    "correct_answer": "a",

      "c": "Everybody does not fear a lion.",
      "d": "There is nobody but fears a lion."
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "A common way to make an affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) sentence with 'Everybody' negative is to use the structure 'There is nobody but + affirmative verb'. 'But' here is a relative pronoun meaning 'who...not'. So, 'There is nobody but fears a lion' means 'There is no one who does not fear a lion', which is the negative equivalent."

      "c": "He confessed that he is guilty.",
      "d": "He confessed for his guilt."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The simple sentence has a noun object ('his guilt'). To make it complex (জটিল), we expand the noun into a noun clause. 'His guilt' becomes 'that he was guilty'. The tense of the main verb ('confessed' - past) requires the clause verb to also be in the past ('was')."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The verb 'please' (খুশি করা) is followed by the preposition 'with' in its passive form. The active sentence is in the past tense, so the passive is 'We were pleased with him'. This is an exception to the usual 'by' phrase."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "For a singular noun ('mistake'), the correct exclamatory (আবেগসূচক) structure is 'What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' Therefore, 'What a big mistake it is!' is correct. Option D is missing the article 'a'."

      "d": "Besides fined, he was imprisoned."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The simple/prepositional phrase 'Besides being fined' implies an addition. In a compound sentence (যৌগিক বাক্য), this addition is best shown by the correlative conjunction 'not only...but also'. So, 'He was not only fined but also imprisoned' is correct."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The simple sentence has the noun phrase 'time for action'. This can be expanded into a complex sentence (জটিল বাক্য) by using an adjective clause. 'For action' implies a time when something should be done. So, 'It is a time when we should act' is correct."

    "explanation": "'Not a little' (কম নয়) is an idiom that means 'much' (প্রচুর). Therefore, the affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) form of the sentence is 'He has much money'. 'A little' means some, which is not the correct equivalent."

      "c": "A book was given me by him.",
      "d": "Both A and B"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "This sentence has two objects: 'me' (indirect object) and 'a book' (direct object). In passive voice (কর্মবাচ্য), either object can become the subject. So, both 'I was given a book by him' and 'A book was given to me by him' are correct."

    "explanation": "The simple sentence with 'too...to' (অত্যন্ত...যে না) can be transformed into a complex sentence (জটিল বাক্য) using the 'so...that...cannot/could not' structure. 'He is so weak that he cannot move' is the correct complex form, containing a main clause and an adverb clause of result."

    "explanation": "A complex sentence (জটিল বাক্য) with a conditional 'If' clause can often be transformed into a compound sentence (যৌগিক বাক্য) using the structure 'Imperative + and + future clause'. 'Run and you will catch the train' is the correct equivalent."

      "d": "He saw me and ran away."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The affirmative structure 'As soon as' (যতক্ষণ না) can be made negative (নেতিবাচক) using 'No sooner...than'. The correct structure requires the past perfect tense in the 'No sooner' clause. So, 'No sooner had he seen me than he ran away' is the correct transformation."

      "d": "Let the promise be kept."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Sentences with 'one' as the subject often become impersonal in the passive. The most natural and common passive form is 'A promise should be kept'. Including 'by one' is grammatically possible but stylistically awkward."

      "d": "Had he no money to buy food?"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The statement uses 'had' as the main verb. In formal English, the interrogative form of a past tense sentence with 'have/had' as the main verb can be formed by inverting the subject and the verb. So, 'Had he any money to buy food?' is correct, though 'Did he have...' is also common in modern usage. Option B is the standard textbook answer for this type of transformation."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A wish can be expressed exclamatorily using 'If' or 'Oh that' followed by a clause. The most common and direct exclamatory (আবেগসূচক) form of 'I wish I could see you once' is 'If I could see you once!'"

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

      "d": "I am surprised at the news."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The verb 'surprise' (আশ্চর্য করা) is often followed by the preposition 'at' in its passive form to express the cause of the surprise. The active sentence is in the past tense, so the passive is 'I was surprised at the news'."

      "d": "His brother is as wise as he."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The positive degree (সকারাত্মক) 'as...as' indicates equality. To express this in the comparative degree (তুলনামূলক), we can use a negative structure. 'He is as wise as his brother' means 'He is not wiser than his brother'. This is a common and correct transformation."

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "'Every plan' (প্রত্যেক পরিকল্পনা) in an affirmative sentence can be made negative (নেতিবাচক) by using the structure 'There is no + noun + but + affirmative verb'. 'There was no plan but he tried it' means 'There was no plan that he did not try', which is the negative equivalent of 'He tried every plan'."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

      "d": "He had been elected captain."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This sentence has an object ('him') and an object complement ('captain'). In the passive voice (কর্মবাচ্য), the object becomes the subject, and the complement remains after the past participle. The active is past tense, so passive is 'He was elected captain by us'."

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "To change this into an exclamatory sentence (আবেগসূচক বাক্য), we focus on the noun phrase 'a cruel man'. The correct structure is 'What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' So, 'What a cruel man he is!' is correct."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",

      "d": "He had been made king."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This sentence has an object ('him') and an object complement ('king'). In the passive voice (কর্মবাচ্য), the object becomes the subject, and the complement ('king') stays after the past participle. The active is past tense, so the passive is 'He was made king by them'."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The positive degree (সকারাত্মক) 'as...as' indicates equality. Its negative form in the comparative degree is 'not + comparative adjective + than'. So, 'His brother is not stronger than him' means the same as 'He is as strong as his brother'."

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "'Weather' is an uncountable noun (অগণনাযোগ্য বিশেষ্য), so we do not use 'a' or 'an' before it. For exclamatory sentences (আবেগসূচক বাক্য) with an adjective, we use 'How' before the adjective. So, 'How fine the weather is today!' is correct."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "'A little known person' means he is not famous. The negative (নেতিবাচক) transformation using 'not' would be 'He is not a well-known person'. This conveys the opposite meaning of 'well-known' (সুপরিচিত)."

This is not a compound sentence, but the question asks for the compound form. However, among the options, none are compound. Option A is the simple form, which is the most direct equivalent of the complex sentence. The best answer here is A, as it represents the non-complex transformation."

      "c": "How innocent the child is!",
      "d": "What innocent child it is!"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "For exclamatory sentences (আবেগসূচক বাক্য) with an adjective, we use 'How' before the adjective. The structure is 'How + adjective + subject + verb!' Here, 'child' is the subject, so 'How innocent the child is!' is correct."

    "options": {
      "a": "Any cloud has a silver lining.",
      "b": "No cloud has a silver lining.",
      "c": "There is no cloud but has a silver lining.",
      "d": "Every cloud does not have a silver lining."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "An affirmative sentence with 'Every' can be made negative (নেতিবাচক) using the structure 'There is no + noun + but + affirmative verb'. 'There is no cloud but has a silver lining' means 'There is no cloud that does not have a silver lining', which is the negative equivalent."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "'Illiterate' (অশিক্ষিত) is the opposite of 'literate' (শিক্ষিত). 'Not illiterate' (অশিক্ষিত নয়) means he is literate. Therefore, the affirmative (হ্যাঁ-সূচক) form is 'He is a literate person'."

      "d": "The work has been finished by him by then."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The active sentence is in the future perfect tense (ভবিষ্যৎ পূর্ণ কাল): 'will have finished'. The passive structure is 'will have been + past participle'. So, 'The work will have been finished by him by then' is correct."

      "c": "Did he had any money to spare?",
      "d": "Both A and B"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "For past tense sentences with 'had' as the main verb, two interrogative forms are possible. The formal one inverts the verb: 'Had he any money to spare?' The more common modern one uses 'did': 'Did he have any money to spare?' Both are acceptable."

      "c": "I have a friend that in America.",
      "d": "I have a friend living in America."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The simple sentence has a prepositional phrase ('in America') modifying the noun 'friend'. To make it complex (জটিল), we expand it into an adjective clause. 'I have a friend who lives in America' is the correct complex form."

      "c": "He is intelligent or hardworking.",
      "d": "He is intelligent, so he is hardworking."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The prepositional phrase 'Besides being intelligent' indicates addition. In a compound sentence (যৌগিক বাক্য), this is best expressed by the correlative conjunction 'not only...but also'. So, 'He is not only intelligent but also hardworking' is correct."

      "d": "What pleasant weather it is!"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "'Weather' is an uncountable noun (অগণনাযোগ্য বিশেষ্য), so we do not use 'a' before it. For exclamatory sentences (আবেগসূচক বাক্য) with an adjective, we use 'How' before the adjective. The structure is 'How + adjective + subject + verb!' So, 'How pleasant the weather is!' is correct."

      "d": "What we cannot cure must be endured by us."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This is a complex sentence. In the passive transformation (কর্মবাচ্য), the object of 'cure' in the subordinate clause becomes the subject of that clause, and the object of 'endure' becomes the subject of the main clause. The most elegant and common passive form is 'What cannot be cured must be endured'."

    },

      "c": "He is sometimes late.",
      "d": "He is always not late."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "'Always' (সবসময়) is the opposite of 'never' (কখনও না). Therefore, the negative (নেতিবাচক) transformation of 'He is always late' is 'He is never late'. This changes the meaning to the opposite, which is the purpose of direct negation."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "For a singular countable noun ('book'), the correct exclamatory (আবেগসূচক) structure is 'What a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' Since 'interesting' starts with a vowel sound, we use 'an'. So, 'What an interesting book it is!' is correct."

      "d": "Be not lazy."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This is a piece of advice in the negative. A negative imperative sentence (নেতিবাচক অনুজ্ঞাসূচক বাক্য) with the verb 'be' is formed with 'Do not be' followed by the complement. So, 'Do not be lazy' is correct."
